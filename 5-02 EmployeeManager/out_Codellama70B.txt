Refactoring:
The Employee class can be made immutable by making its fields final and providing only getters, not setters. This will ensure that the employee's data cannot be changed after creation.
The EmployeeManager class can be made thread-safe by making the employees list thread-safe, e.g., by using a CopyOnWriteArrayList instead of an ArrayList.
The addEmployee method can be simplified by using a constructor with parameters for the Employee class.
The printAllEmployees method can be simplified by using a stream and String.join to print the employees.
The findEmployeeById method can be optimized by using a Map to store employees by ID, which will provide faster lookup.
The calculateAverageAge method can be simplified by using a stream and average to calculate the average age.
Optimizations:
The findEmployeeById method can be optimized by using a Map to store employees by ID, which will provide faster lookup.
The calculateAverageAge method can be optimized by using a stream and average to calculate the average age.
Suggestions:
Consider using a database or a data structure like a Map to store employees, which will provide faster lookup and manipulation.
Consider using a constructor with parameters for the Employee class to simplify the creation of employees.
Consider using a stream and String.join to simplify the printing of employees.
Consider using a stream and average to simplify the calculation of the average age.
Please note that these suggestions are based on the provided code and may not be applicable to your specific use case. It's always a good idea to consider the requirements, performance, and maintainability when refactoring and optimizing code.
