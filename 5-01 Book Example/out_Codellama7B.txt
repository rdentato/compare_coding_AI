The code provided is a good start, but there are some areas that can be optimized and refactored for better performance and readability. Here are some suggestions:

Use a more descriptive variable name than arr for the array parameter in the calculateAndSort function. A name like inputArray or data would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than mean for the mean parameter in the calculateAndSort function. A name like average or meanValue would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than median for the median parameter in the calculateAndSort function. A name like medianValue or middleValue would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than mode for the mode parameter in the calculateAndSort function. A name like mostFrequentValue or modeValue would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than sum for the sum variable in the calculateAndSort function. A name like total or sumOfValues would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than maxCount for the maximum count variable in the calculateAndSort function. A name like maxFrequency or mostFrequentCount would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than temp for the temporary variable in the calculateAndSort function. A name like swap or tempValue would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than i for the loop variable in the calculateAndSort function. A name like j or k would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than j for the loop variable in the calculateAndSort function. A name like k or l would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than size for the array size parameter in the calculateAndSort function. A name like arrayLength or dataSize would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than size for the array size parameter in the main function. A name like dataSize or arrayLength would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than data for the array in the main function. A name like inputData or sortedData would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than mean for the mean variable in the main function. A name like average or meanValue would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than median for the median variable in the main function. A name like medianValue or middleValue would be more appropriate.
Use a more descriptive variable name than mode for the mode variable in the main function. A name like mostFrequentValue or modeValue would be more appropriate.
Here is an example of how the code could be refactored using these suggestions:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#define ARRAY_SIZE 10

// Function declaration
void calculateAndSort(int *inputArray, int arrayLength, float *average, float *median, int *mostFrequentValue);

// Main function
int main() {
    int data[ARRAY_SIZE] = {7, 8, 9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 3, 4};
    float average = 0.0f, median = 0.0f;
    int mostFrequentValue = 0;
    calculateAndSort(data, ARRAY_SIZE, &average, &median, &mostFrequentValue);
    printf("After processing:\n");
    printf("Average: %.2f\n", average);
    printf("Median: %.2f\n", median);
    printf("Mode: %d\n", mostFrequentValue);
    printf("Sorted Array: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        printf("%d ", data[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}

// Complex function that calculates mean, median, mode and sorts the array
void calculateAndSort(int *inputArray, int arrayLength, float *average, float *median, int *mostFrequentValue) {
    int total = 0, maxFrequency = 0;
    *mostFrequentValue = inputArray[0];
    // Calculating mean
    for (int i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
        total += inputArray[i];
    }
    *average = (float)total / arrayLength;
    // Sorting array for median calculation
    for (int i = 0; i < arrayLength - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arrayLength - i - 1; j++) {
            if (inputArray[j] > inputArray[j + 1]) {
                int temp = inputArray[j];
                inputArray[j] = inputArray[j + 1];
                inputArray[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    // Calculating median
    if (arrayLength % 2 == 0) {
        *median = (inputArray[arrayLength / 2 - 1] + inputArray[arrayLength / 2]) / 2.0;
    } else {
        *median = inputArray[arrayLength / 2];
    }
    // Calculating mode
    for (int i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
        int frequency = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < arrayLength; j++) {
            if (inputArray[j] == inputArray[i])
                frequency++;
        }
        if (frequency > maxFrequency) {
            maxFrequency = frequency;
            *mostFrequentValue = inputArray[i];
        }
    }
}
