The provided code defines a function check_lessons that performs a check on lesson scheduling within a database of lessons, aiming to identify any overlapping lessons based on their scheduled times, days, and classroom allocations. Here is a detailed explanation of the components and logic used in the code:

Connection and Cursor: The function accepts a db_connection parameter, which is an open connection to an SQLite database. It uses this connection to create a cursor object, which is necessary for executing SQL queries and fetching results.

SQL Query Explanation:

The query performs a self-join on the lessons table (aliased as l1 and l2 for each instance of the table in the join). This is necessary to compare every lesson against every other lesson.
The WHERE clause filters out pairs of lessons where:
The lessons are different (l1.lesson_id != l2.lesson_id).
They are assigned to the same classroom (l1.classroom_id = l2.classroom_id).
They are on the same weekday (l1.weekday = l2.weekday).
There is a time overlap, checked by two conditions to ensure that any part of one lesson's period falls within the other's. This is determined by comparing the start times and durations of the lessons.
The SELECT statement retrieves the lesson IDs (lesson_id), the classroom ID (classroom_id), the weekday, and the start times and durations for the overlapping lessons.
Execution and Fetching Results: The query is executed using the cursor.execute method, and cursor.fetchall() is used to retrieve all the rows that matched the query conditions. These rows represent pairs of lessons with scheduling conflicts.

Return Value: The function returns verified, which is a list of tuples representing the lesson pairs with their respective IDs, classroom ID, day of the week, and timing details that have overlaps.

    """
    Identifies and returns a list of overlapping lessons based on classroom, day, and time.

    This function queries the database to find pairs of lessons that are scheduled in the same room on the same day and have overlapping times based on their start times and durations.

    Parameters:
    - db_connection: A sqlite3.Connection object representing an open connection to the database.

    Returns:
    - A list of tuples, where each tuple contains details of overlapping lesson pairs, including their IDs, classroom ID, day of the week, start times, and durations.
