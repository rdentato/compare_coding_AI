The provided code has several security issues:

SQL Injection: The code uses a dynamic SQL query to retrieve data from the database, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code to steal sensitive data or escalate privileges.
Broken Authentication: The code uses a hardcoded password for the database connection, which is a common vulnerability known as "hardcoded credentials." If an attacker can obtain the password, they can gain unauthorized access to the database.
Insecure Deserialization: The code uses the ObjectInputStream class to deserialize an object from a file, which can lead to a security vulnerability known as "deserialization of untrusted data." If an attacker can control the contents of the file, they could potentially execute malicious code on the system.
Insecure File Access: The code uses the FileInputStream class to read a file from the file system, which can lead to a security vulnerability known as "file inclusion vulnerabilities." If an attacker can control the file name, they could potentially read sensitive data or execute malicious code.
Insecure Command Execution: The code uses the System.out.println() method to print a message to the console, which can lead to a security vulnerability known as "command execution vulnerabilities." If an attacker can control the message, they could potentially execute malicious commands on the system.
To fix these issues, the code should use prepared statements, parameterized queries, and secure file access mechanisms, such as FileInputStream with a secure file path. Additionally, the code should use a secure password storage mechanism, such as BCrypt or Argon2, to store the password securely.
