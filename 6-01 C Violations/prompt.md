Consider the following style guidelines for C programming:
Guidelines {
[01] Meaningful names for variables, constants and functions. Do not use camelcase; use underscores for multi-word variables. For example, use hot_water_temperature instead of hotWaterTemperature. Using a variable name with a single character is only appropriate if the variable is the iteration variable of a loop; otherwise using a single character variable is not correct. For example, if a variable represents a sum, name it sum instead of s.
[02] Good indentation (3 or 4 spaces). Use a proper editor (e.g., emacs, vi) that assists with indentation.
[03] If variables have the same type, declare them on the same line if possible.
[04] Leave one blank line between variable declarations and the first line of code in a function.
[05] Consistent style (e.g., use of curly brackets).
[06] Opening brace must be on the same line as conditional or function.
[07] Define values as constants when needed (do not use variables for constants). Do not use numbers in your expressions if those numbers have a special meaning (e.g., 3.1415); instead define constants (e.g., using #define) for them.
[08] #defined constants must be in uppercase (e.g., #define MAX_LEN 10 and NOT #define max_len 10).
[09] In your code you should leave one blank space between operators (e.g., x = 5 + 7).
[10] Leave one space after a comma.
[11] If the code is too complicated to be read on its own, simplify/split/rename variables.
[12] Use braces; avoid loops and conditionals without them.
[13] Use parentheses for clarity, especially with bit operations.
[14] Avoid global variables where they are unnecessary.
[15] If p is a pointer to a structure, you should access members by using p->member rather than (*p).member.
[16] If p is a pointer to a structure, do not surround the -> operator with spaces (use p->id instead of p -> id).
[17] You should avoid source lines exceeding 80 characters. You can use the linecheck command in the grace system to verify you have lines with the appropriate length.
[18] Use the indent utility (after setting the alias as described in the grace info folder indent_utility_info.txt) and run it against a copy of your code. Compare the indentation generated by the utility and your original code.
[19] You must avoid code duplication.
[20] Make sure you read all the information on this page. You will lose credit if you don't follow the suggestions we have defined.
}

Check the following code for violations of the guidelines and suggest a fix:
```
#include <stdio.h>

struct Point {
    int x,y;
};

int g = 10;

void calculateArea() 
{
int r=5;
float area=3.1415*r*r;
printf("Area: %f\n",area);
}

void displayPoints(struct Point *points, int count){
    int i=0;
    struct Point *p = points;
    while(i<count) if(p -> x > 10) printf("Point %d: x = %d, y = %d\n",i++,p -> x,p -> y); else i++;
}

int main() {
    struct Point points[] = {{12, 5}, {3, 4}, {15, 10}, {7, 8}};
    displayPoints(points, 4);
    calculateArea();
    return 0;
}

```
