Here are some suggestions to fix the violations of the style guidelines in the provided code:

[01] Use meaningful names for variables. For example, use PI instead of 3.1415.

Replace:

float area=3.1415*r*r;
With:

float area = PI * r * r;
And add the definition of PI as a constant:

Replace:

#include <stdio.h>
With:

#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.1415
[02] Use good indentation. For example, the while loop in the displayPoints function should be indented more.

Replace:

while(i<count) if(p -> x > 10) printf("Point %d: x = %d, y = %d\n",i++,p -> x,p -> y); else i++;
