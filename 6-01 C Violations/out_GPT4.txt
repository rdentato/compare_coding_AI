The provided code has several style guideline violations:

Global Variable int g = 10; violates [14] Avoid global variables where unnecessary.

Magic Number in calculateArea float area=3.1415*r*r; violates [07] Define values as constants.

Use of CamelCase in Function Name void calculateArea() violates [01] Meaningful names... use underscores.

Space with -> Operator if(p -> x > 10) violates [16] Do not surround the -> operator with spaces.

Opening Brace Position in void calculateArea() and void displayPoints(struct Point *points, int count){ violates [06] Opening brace must be on the same line.

Line Length The line printf("Point %d: x = %d, y = %d\n",i++,p -> x,p -> y); may exceed 80 characters, violating [17] Avoid source lines exceeding 80 characters.

Use of #define for Constants The number 3.1415 should be defined as a constant, also following [08] #defined constants must be in uppercase.

Missing Braces Around Control-flow Statements The while loop in displayPoints violates [12] Use braces; avoid loops and conditionals without them.

Indentation While not explicitly incorrect without a clear specification, ensuring good indentation adherence is mentioned. This code should be checked for consistent indentation per [02] Good indentation (3 or 4 spaces).

Single Statement in Loop Without Braces The while loop in displayPoints does not use braces for its body, violating [12].

Suggested fixes:

[01], [03]: Rename calculateArea to calculate_area.
[07], [08]: Use a #define for 3.1415, e.g., #define PI 3.1415.
[14]: Evaluate if int g = 10; is necessary; if not, remove it.
[16]: Use if (p->x > 10) instead of if (p -> x > 10).
[06]: Place the opening brace on the same line as the function definition.
[12]: Add braces around the loop body in displayPoints.
[17]: Consider breaking the printf statement into multiple lines or storing intermediate results in variables to reduce line length.
[02]: Ensure indentations are consistent with the chosen guidelines (3 or 4 spaces).
Revised code snippet with the major issues addressed:

#include <stdio.h>

#define PI 3.14159

struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

void calculate_area() {
    int r = 5;
    float area = PI * r * r;
    printf("Area: %f\n", area);
}

void display_points(struct Point *points, int count) {
    int i = 0;
    struct Point *p = points;
    while (i < count) {
        if (p->x > 10) {
            printf("Point %d: x = %d, y = %d\n", i++, p->x, p->y);
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    struct Point points[] = {{12, 5}, {3, 4}, {15, 10}, {7, 8}};
    display_points(points, 4);
    calculate_area();
    return 0;
}
