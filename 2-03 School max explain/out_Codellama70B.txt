Import the sqlite3 module, which is used to interact with SQLite databases.
Define a function check_classroom_capacity that takes a parameter db_path, which is the path to the SQLite database file.
Create a connection to the database using sqlite3.connect(db_path).
Create a cursor object using db.cursor().
Execute a SQL query that:
Selects the CourseID, Subject, ClassroomID, RoomNumber, Building, Capacity, and StudentCount (calculated as the count of StudentIDs) from the COURSE, ENROLLMENT, LESSON, and CLASSROOM tables.
Joins the COURSE table with the ENROLLMENT table on CourseID.
Joins the LESSON table with the COURSE table on CourseID.
Joins the CLASSROOM table with the LESSON table on ClassroomID.
Groups the results by CourseID and ClassroomID.
Filters the results to only include those where the StudentCount is greater than the Capacity of the classroom.
Fetch all the results from the query using cursor.fetchall().
Close the database connection using db.close().
Return the results from the function.
