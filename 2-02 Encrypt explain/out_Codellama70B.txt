This function performs a transformation on the input string src and stores the result in the output string dst. The transformation is based on the following rules:

If a character in src is a digit (0-9), it is replaced with its reverse (9-0).
If a character in src is an uppercase letter (A-Z), it is rotated 13 places (using the rot13 function) and then XORed with the corresponding character in the key string.
If a character in src is a lowercase letter (a-z), it is XORed with the corresponding character in the key string.
All other characters are copied unchanged.
The key string is used to modify the transformed characters. It is cycled through, starting from the first character, and the current character is used to modify the corresponding character in src.

The function returns 0 if the transformation is successful, or -1 if the key string is empty.

The function assumes that dst is large enough to hold the transformed string.
