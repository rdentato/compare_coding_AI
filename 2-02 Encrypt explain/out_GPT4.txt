This C function performs a mixed transformation on a source string src, writing the result to a destination string dst using a transformation key key. The transformation applied to each character in the source string depends on the character's type (digit, uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or other). The function returns 0 upon successful transformation or -1 if the key is empty. The transformation rules are as follows:

Digits ('0'-'9') are transformed into their complement to 9. For example, '0' becomes '9', '1' becomes '8', etc.
Uppercase letters ('A'-'Z') are first subjected to a ROT13 transformation, then XORed with the current byte in the key. The ROT13 transformation shifts each letter by 13 places in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary.
Lowercase letters ('a'-'z') are directly XORed with the current byte in the key.
Other characters are left unchanged.
The key is used cyclically; if it is shorter than src, it starts over from the beginning once it reaches its end.
The function assumes that dst has enough space to store the transformed string plus the null terminator. It ensures the resulting string is null-terminated.

/**
 * Performs a mixed encryption transformation on a string.
 * 
 * This function encrypts the input string `src` according to a set of rules,
 * writing the encrypted version to `dst` using the encryption `key`.
 * Digits are inverted (complement to 9), uppercase letters are ROT13 and XORed
 * with the key, and lowercase letters are directly XORed with the key. Other
 * characters are left unchanged. The transformation cycles through the key
 * for each character of the input.
 * 
 * @param dst The buffer where the transformed string is written.
 * @param src The input string to be transformed.
 * @param key The key used for the XOR encryption part of the transformation.
 * @return Returns 0 on successful transformation, -1 if the key is empty.
