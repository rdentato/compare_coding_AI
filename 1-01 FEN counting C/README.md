# FEN Counting

The first experiment in our exploration of artificial intelligence's capability to assist in coding involves a specific task centered around the game of chess. We aim to evaluate the AI's possession of seemingly unrelated knowledge by engaging it in a programming challenge that requires both coding skills and chess understanding. This task, whimsically named the "Kittens Test," involves writing a function capable of processing a chess position encoded in Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN). The objective for the AI is to analyze the given FEN string and subsequently populate an array with the total count of each type of chess piece present on the board. This test is designed to assess the AI model's ability to interpret and manipulate data in a context that blends specific domain knowledge (in this case, the rules and pieces of chess) with general programming capabilities. The experiment's success would demonstrate the AI's versatility and its potential utility in scenarios that require a blend of technical and specialized knowledge.
