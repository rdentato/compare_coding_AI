To achieve at least 90% coverage with unit tests for the encrypt function, consider the following test cases. These cases cover various elements including the behavior with different inputs, the handling of the key's length, and boundary conditions:

Empty Key Test: Test with an empty key, which should return -1 to indicate an error.

char dst[100];
assertEquals(-1, encrypt(dst, "Hello", ""));
Single Character Key (Non-repeat Cycle Test): Test encryption with a single character key to see how the ciphertext is generated without key cycling.

char dst[100];
encrypt(dst, "Hello1", "A");
assertEquals(0, strcmp(dst, <EXPECTED_RESULT>));
The expected result needs calculation based on the description.

Multi-character Key with Cycling: Test with a multi-character key that requires cycling through the key for the entire input string.

char dst[100];
encrypt(dst, "Hello, World!", "Key");
assertEquals(0, strcmp(dst, <EXPECTED_RESULT>));
Ensure the cycling corresponds accurately with the input.

Digits Transformation: Verify that digits are appropriately inverted.

char dst[100];
encrypt(dst, "123", "A");
assertEquals(0, strcmp(dst, "876"));
Lowercase Transformation Without Key Impact: Testing the transformation of lowercase letters to check if XOR operation with key works as intended.

char dst[100];
encrypt(dst, "abc", "B");
assertEquals(0, strcmp(dst, <EXPECTED_RESULT>));
Uppercase Transformation Including ROT13 and XOR: Similar to testcase 5 but for uppercase letters, using both ROT13 and XOR with the key.

char dst[100];
encrypt(dst, "ABC", "N");
assertEquals(0, strcmp(dst, <EXPECTED_RESULT>));
Non-alphanumeric Characters: Ensure that non-alphanumeric characters are unchanged.

char dst[100];
encrypt(dst, "!@#", "Key");
assertEquals(0, strcmp(dst, "!@#"));
Long String with Multiple Key Cycles: Encrypt a longer string that requires multiple cycles through the key.

char dst[100];
encrypt(dst, "This is a long string.", "Loop");
assertEquals(0, strcmp(dst, <EXPECTED_RESULT>));
Input String Length of Zero: Check the function's behavior with an empty input string.

char dst[100] = "";
encrypt(dst, "", "key");
assertEquals(0, strlen(dst));
Ensure that dst remains an empty string.

Null Inputs: Depending on the specifications and robustness requirements, tests could also be designed to handle or report errors for NULL inputs. However, based on the provided function prototype, it's not clear if these cases are considered.

These cases should collectively ensure comprehensive coverage of the functionality, corner cases, and error handling in the encryption function.
