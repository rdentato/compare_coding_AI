The code has several potential security issues:

gets() function is used, which is dangerous as it does not check the array size, leading to buffer overflow. Use fgets() instead.
The system() function executes a command through the system shell, which is a significant security risk. It can lead to arbitrary command execution.
The secret_key is transmitted and stored in plaintext, which is insecure. Use secure methods for storing and transmitting sensitive data.
The retriveDepositAmount() function is called with user_input and "qwerty" as arguments, but the function is not defined in the provided code, so its security can't be evaluated.
The code format is inconsistent, making it hard to read and maintain.
To improve security, consider the following:

Use fgets() to safely get user input.
Replace system() with a safer alternative for executing commands.
Use encryption and secure transmission methods for sensitive data.
Provide a secure storage mechanism for sensitive data.
Ensure consistent code formatting for readability and maintainability.
