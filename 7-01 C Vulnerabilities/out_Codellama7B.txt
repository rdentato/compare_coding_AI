This code has several potential security issues:

Buffer overflow: The user_input array has a size of 100, but the gets function does not perform any bounds checking. This means that if a user enters more than 100 characters, the extra characters will overflow into the command array, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack.
Command injection: The system function takes a string as an argument, which can be controlled by the user. If a user enters a command that is not intended by the program, it can lead to a command injection attack. For example, if the user enters the command "rm -rf /", it will delete all files in the system.
Insecure password storage: The secret_key array is stored in plaintext, which means that if the program is compromised, the attacker can easily access the secret key. It is recommended to use a secure password storage mechanism, such as bcrypt or argon2.
Insecure data retrieval: The retriveDepositAmount function takes a string as an argument, which can be controlled by the user. If a user enters a string that is not a valid deposit amount, it can lead to a security vulnerability. It is recommended to use a secure data retrieval mechanism, such as a database or a secure file system.
Insecure input validation: The grantAccess function does not validate the user input before using it. This means that if a user enters invalid input, it can lead to a security vulnerability. It is recommended to validate all user input before using it.
To fix these issues, the code should be modified to use secure functions and data structures, such as fgets instead of gets, strcpy instead of strcat, and bcrypt or argon2 for password storage. Additionally, the input validation should be improved to ensure that only valid input is accepted.
