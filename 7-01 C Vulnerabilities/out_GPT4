This code has several potential security issues:

Use of gets() Function: This function is unsafe because it does not check the array bounds and can cause buffer overflows. Attackers can exploit this to inject arbitrary code into the program.

Buffer Overflow via strcat(command, user_input): Since command is initialized with a length of 150 and already contains a string ("echo "), appending a large user input can overflow the buffer, leading to potential execution of arbitrary commands or code.

Use of system(command) with User Input: Concatenating user input to a command string and executing it without validation or sanitization poses a security risk, as it can execute arbitrary shell commands (command injection).

Insecure Comparison of Secret Key: The use of strcmp for secret key comparison can be vulnerable to timing attacks, as it compares characters one by one and returns as soon as a mismatch is found.

Displaying the Secret Key: Printing the secret key to the output could expose sensitive information in logs or to shoulder surfers.

Buffer Overflow via gets(secret_key): Similar to the first point, using gets() for secret_key can lead to buffer overflow since there is no boundary checking.

Potential Undefined Function retriveDepositAmount: The code snippet calls a function retriveDepositAmount(user_input,"qwerty") that is not defined within the provided snippet. If this function processes the user_input without proper sanitization, it could lead to additional vulnerabilities (assuming it's a typo for "retrieveDepositAmount").

Improper Error Handling: If the secret key does not match "qwerty", the function simply returns 0 without cleaning up or securely handling the incorrect attempt.

Assumed Incorrect Spelling in Output: Minor, but "Your total cash deposit is: %d$" may expose internal details or simply be an inadvertent error, and "scret" should be "secret". Though not a direct security issue, it reflects potential carelessness in handling output that might extend to sensitive data handling elsewhere.

Use of Literal for Sensitive Data: Hardcoding the secret key ("qwerty") within the code is insecure practice, making it easier for attackers to find and exploit.

Addressing these issues involves using safer functions (e.g., fgets instead of gets), validating and sanitizing input, not executing user-controlled input, securely comparing sensitive data, avoiding the exposure of sensitive information, and proper error handling.
