Based on the provided requirements, the following requirements overlap or contradict each other:

User Friendliness and Real-time Updates: These two requirements are in conflict, as providing real-time updates may make the system less user-friendly, as users may not be able to keep up with the constant updates.
User Friendliness and Customizability: These two requirements are in conflict, as providing a customizable interface may make the system less user-friendly, as users may not be able to understand or use the customized interface.
System Integrity and Data Analysis: These two requirements are in conflict, as providing comprehensive data analysis may require a significant amount of time and resources, which may not be available to ensure the system's integrity.
System Integrity and Uniformity in Experience: These two requirements are in conflict, as providing a uniform user experience may not be feasible if the system is not able to perform comprehensive data analysis and provide accurate data to users.
Security and Multi-factor Authentication: These two requirements are in conflict, as implementing multi-factor authentication may not be feasible if the system is not able to provide a secure environment for user data.
Overall, it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs between these requirements and prioritize the most critical requirements that are in conflict.
